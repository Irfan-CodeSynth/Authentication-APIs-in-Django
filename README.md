# Authentication-APIs-in-Django
This repository contains a robust implementation of authentication APIs in Django, designed to provide secure and efficient user authentication mechanisms for web applications. The project leverages Django's built-in authentication framework and extends it with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.
